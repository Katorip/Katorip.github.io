"Bubble Generator" was a school project which took me 2 days to make.

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

Test: https://katorip.github.io

Implement www-page using html, Javascript and css (=do not use external libraries except bootstrap (optional)), which
has three sections: header, container and footer. Header width is 80% (centered) and height is about 10%. Header
contains text "bubbles" (at the moment). Container is also 80% wide and its height is bigger (~80%). Footer height is
about 10% and it contains the name of the developer in the middle.

Inside the container there is 10 pieces of bubbles (=circles), which "travels" around the container at random speed and
random direction. The direction and speed changes when the bubble bounces back from the containers wall.

Implement the animation using Javascript: create one interval handler function, which takes care of all the bubbles
movement (requestAnimationFrame can also be used). Use JS objects and classes as appropriate. Define one global
config object which is used to define the operation so that it can be changed easily. Do not pollute the namespace.

When the bubble is clicked, console shows the number of the clicked bubble.
